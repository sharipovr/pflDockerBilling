Here's a clear, structured, and actionable **one-week plan** (4-5 hours/day) to create an impressive portfolio tailored specifically to the Docker Senior Backend Engineer role, incorporating technologies from the job description:

---

## üöÄ **Portfolio Project Idea: "Docker Billing Platform"**

A simplified yet powerful representation of a billing system with front-end and backend components, emphasizing Docker, Golang, cloud deployments, billing systems (using Stripe API), consumption-based metrics, and CI/CD.

---

## üìÖ **Day-by-Day Plan**

### üìå Day 1: **Planning & Setup (4-5 hrs)**
- **Design your project architecture**:
  - Frontend: React (minimal, clean UI)
  - Backend: Golang API
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  - Infrastructure: Docker containers, Kubernetes (on Linode or AWS EKS)
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions

- **Tasks**:
  - Create GitHub repository and initial folder structure
  - Setup local environment (Go, Docker Desktop, Node.js, PostgreSQL client)
  - Write initial README describing project goals, technology stack, and architecture diagram

---

### üìå Day 2: **Backend Foundations (4-5 hrs)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Build basic Golang backend with RESTful API endpoints:
    - `/users`: manage customer records
    - `/subscriptions`: handle basic subscription CRUD
  - Setup PostgreSQL schema and initial migrations
  - Integrate database with GORM or sqlx (preferred ORMs for Golang)

- **Deliverables**:
  - Working backend with simple CRUD operations and tested API endpoints
  - Dockerfile for Golang backend
  - Docker Compose for local testing

---

### üìå Day 3: **Frontend Foundations (4-5 hrs)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a simple React app frontend:
    - Authentication page (minimal mockup)
    - User dashboard showing subscription status, billing details
  - Connect frontend to backend APIs
  - Setup frontend Dockerfile

- **Deliverables**:
  - Basic React app interacting with backend services
  - Frontend containerized with Docker

---

### üìå Day 4: **Billing Integration & Consumption Metrics (4-5 hrs)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate Stripe API (test mode) for billing transactions:
    - Subscription creation
    - Payment processing
    - Invoice generation (PDF export would be impressive, optional)
  - Implement basic consumption metrics:
    - API usage tracking
    - Threshold alerts (simple mock notification via email/console log)

- **Deliverables**:
  - Functional billing and subscription management system
  - Consumption-based billing logic implemented

---

### üìå Day 5: **Cloud Deployment & CI/CD (4-5 hrs)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy project infrastructure using Terraform (IaC):
    - AWS: EKS (Kubernetes), RDS PostgreSQL
    - Or Linode Kubernetes Engine
  - Setup GitHub Actions pipeline:
    - Automated tests, build Docker images, deploy to Kubernetes cluster

- **Deliverables**:
  - Fully automated deployment from GitHub to cloud Kubernetes cluster
  - Application available on cloud, accessible via URL

---

### üìå Day 6: **Documentation & Testing (4-5 hrs)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Write clear documentation on:
    - Infrastructure setup (Terraform files)
    - Application setup and configuration
    - Development and deployment instructions
  - Enhance Go backend with automated tests:
    - Unit, integration, and basic e2e tests

- **Deliverables**:
  - Comprehensive GitHub project documentation
  - Coverage of Golang backend tests

---

### üìå Day 7: **Polishing & Enhancements (4-5 hrs)**
- **Tasks**:
  - Refine frontend UI/UX (minimal but clean)
  - Add extra features showcasing skills:
    - Simple admin page (view customer subscriptions, billing status)
    - Reporting feature (basic charts of billing and usage history)
  - Finalize GitHub repository:
    - Tag release, clear commit history, polished README

- **Deliverables**:
  - Clean, minimalistic frontend enhancements
  - Fully operational backend and frontend
  - Well-maintained and professional GitHub repository, ready for presentation

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Recommended Technology Stack:**

- **Languages & Frameworks:**
  - Backend: Golang (REST API)
  - Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS for quick & clean UI
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL (cloud-managed via AWS RDS or Linode)
- **Billing & Payments:**
  - Stripe API (testing environment)
- **Infrastructure & DevOps:**
  - Docker containers
  - Kubernetes (AWS EKS or Linode Kubernetes)
  - Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- **Documentation & Testing:**
  - Swagger/OpenAPI for documenting APIs
  - Go standard testing framework for backend

---

## üéØ **Focus Areas to Highlight:**

Your project should clearly showcase your expertise in:

- **Docker and containerization**: backend, frontend, database containers.
- **Golang backend**: RESTful APIs, clear coding style, testing, error handling.
- **Billing systems**: Subscription management, invoicing, Stripe integration.
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS or Linode, demonstrating cloud skills.
- **CI/CD Automation**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**: Managing infrastructure reproducibly.
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Demonstrate clear architecture, simple API consumption.
- **Documentation**: Clear README, well-commented code, API docs (Swagger).

---

## üìå **Outcome:**

By the end of the week, you'll have a cohesive, impressive portfolio demonstrating skills directly aligned with the Docker Billing Team‚Äôs requirements:

- Docker & Kubernetes experience
- Strong Golang backend development
- SaaS Billing & Stripe integration
- Consumption-based metrics and alerting
- AWS/Linode cloud experience
- CI/CD and DevOps practices

This portfolio will position you as a highly capable and standout candidate for the role at Docker.
